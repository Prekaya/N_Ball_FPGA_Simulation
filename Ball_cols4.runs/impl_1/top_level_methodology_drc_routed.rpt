2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clkdivider/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_65 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_65]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_65 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_65]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clkdivider/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clkdivider/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_65 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell myf/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/gbi.bi/g7ser_birst.rstbt/gf18e1_inst.sngfifo18e1_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) myf/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/gbi.bi/v7_bi_fifo.fblk/gextw[1].gnll_fifo.inst_extd/gonep.inst_prim/gf18e1_inst.sngfifo18e1/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.242 ns between cur_bram_reg_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and rgb_reg[11]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_65). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
